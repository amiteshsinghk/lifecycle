üìå Activity & Fragment Lifecycle Logger
This repository demonstrates the lifecycle behavior of Activities and Fragments, including logging when navigating between them and when opening UI components like BottomSheets, AlertDialogs, and DialogFragments.

‚ú® Features
‚úîÔ∏è Logs lifecycle methods of Activity and Fragment during navigation.
‚úîÔ∏è Prints logs when opening BottomSheetDialog, AlertDialog, and DialogFragment from both Activity and Fragment.
‚úîÔ∏è Helps analyze how lifecycle events behave when UI components are displayed.
‚úîÔ∏è Useful for debugging and understanding lifecycle transitions.

üõ† Usage
Run the app and navigate between Activities and Fragments.
Open a BottomSheet, AlertDialog, or DialogFragment and observe the lifecycle logs.
Compare the behavior when switching screens versus displaying dialogs.
üìå Surprising Insight: The logs reveal that opening a BottomSheet, AlertDialog, or DialogFragment does not trigger any lifecycle methods in the hosting Activity or Fragment‚Äînot even onPause(). üöÄ

üì± Test Device
‚úîÔ∏è Device Model: OnePlus Nord 2
‚úîÔ∏è Android Version: 13

### üöÄ Application Walkthrough

To observe lifecycle methods, **clone the repository** and filter logs by **`DemoL`** in **Logcat**.

1. When the app launches, it opens the **MainActivity**.
2. The MainActivity includes several buttons:
   - **Open Fragment**: Launches a new Activity containing a Fragment. Fragment lifecycle methods are logged in Logcat.
   - **Bottom Sheet**: Opens a BottomSheetDialog and logs its lifecycle methods. Activity lifecycle methods remain unchanged.
   - **Simple Alert Dialog**: Displays an AlertDialog. No Activity lifecycle methods are triggered.
   - **Dialog Fragment**: Opens a DialogFragment and logs its lifecycle methods. Again, Activity lifecycle methods are not called.
   - **Floating Action Button**: Launches a new Activity. Lifecycle methods of both current and new Activities are logged.

* **When you open the application Activity1 start and open the next activity2 and click back. Activity lifecycle will be:**
    - MainActivityLog          D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onDestroy() called

* **When you open the application Activity1 start and open the next activity2 and open next activity 3 and click back. Activity lifecycle will be:**
    - MainActivityLog         D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onDestroy() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onDestroy() called

* **When an activity with a fragment is launched, what is the sequence of lifecycle methods called for both the activity and the fragment?**
    - Activity  onCreate() called
    - Frag      onAttach called
    - Frag      onCreate called
    - Frag      onCreateView called
    - Frag      onViewCreated called
    - Frag      onViewStateRestored called
    - Frag      onStart called
    - Activity  onStart() called
    - Activity  onResume() called
    - Frag      onResume called

* **When a BottomSheet/ Alert dialog / Dialog Fragment is opened from an Activity or Fragment, which lifecycle methods of the Activity/Fragment are triggered?** 
    - None of the Activity or Fragment lifecycle methods are called.
    - A video demonstrates that opening a BottomSheet, AlertDialog, or DialogFragment from an Activity or Fragment does not trigger any lifecycle methods in the hosting Activity or Fragment‚Äînot even onPause(), which is quite surprising.

1. When the app is launched, sent to the background, and brought back to the foreground, all lifecycle methods of the **Activity** are logged in the console.  
2. When a **BottomSheet** is opened and closed, all its lifecycle methods are triggered, but **none** of the Activity‚Äôs lifecycle methods are called.  
3. When an **AlertDialog** is opened and closed, **no Activity lifecycle methods** are triggered.  
4. The same behavior is observed when a **DialogFragment** is opened and closed‚Äî**no Activity lifecycle methods** are invoked.  
5. The same pattern applies when these dialogs are opened from a **Fragment**‚Äîthe hosting Fragment‚Äôs lifecycle methods remain untouched.
