üìå Activity & Fragment Lifecycle Logger
This repository demonstrates the lifecycle behavior of Activities and Fragments, including logging when navigating between them and when opening UI components like BottomSheets, AlertDialogs, and DialogFragments.

‚ú® Features
‚úîÔ∏è Logs lifecycle methods of Activity and Fragment during navigation.
‚úîÔ∏è Prints logs when opening BottomSheetDialog, AlertDialog, and DialogFragment from both Activity and Fragment.
‚úîÔ∏è Helps analyze how lifecycle events behave when UI components are displayed.
‚úîÔ∏è Useful for debugging and understanding lifecycle transitions.

üõ† Usage
Run the app and navigate between Activities and Fragments.
Open a BottomSheet, AlertDialog, or DialogFragment and observe the lifecycle logs.
Compare the behavior when switching screens versus displaying dialogs.
üìå Surprising Insight: The logs reveal that opening a BottomSheet, AlertDialog, or DialogFragment does not trigger any lifecycle methods in the hosting Activity or Fragment‚Äînot even onPause(). üöÄ

* **When you open the application Activity1 start and open the next activity2 and click back. Activity lifecycle will be:**
    - MainActivityLog          D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog          D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2         D  onDestroy() called

* **When you open the application Activity1 start and open the next activity2 and open next activity 3 and click back. Activity lifecycle will be:**
    - MainActivityLog         D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onCreate() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog3        D  onDestroy() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onPause() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onStart() called
    - MainActivityLog         D  onResume() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onStop() called
    - MainActivityLog2        D  onDestroy() called

* **When an activity with a fragment is launched, what is the sequence of lifecycle methods called for both the activity and the fragment?**
    - Activity  onCreate() called
    - Frag      onAttach called
    - Frag      onCreate called
    - Frag      onCreateView called
    - Frag      onViewCreated called
    - Frag      onViewStateRestored called
    - Frag      onStart called
    - Activity  onStart() called
    - Activity  onResume() called
    - Frag      onResume called

* **When a BottomSheet/ Alert dialog / Dialog Fragment is opened from an Activity or Fragment, which lifecycle methods of the Activity/Fragment are triggered?** 
    - None of the Activity or Fragment lifecycle methods are called.
    - A video demonstrates that opening a BottomSheet, AlertDialog, or DialogFragment from an Activity or Fragment does not trigger any lifecycle methods in the hosting Activity or Fragment‚Äînot even onPause(), which is quite surprising.
